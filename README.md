reCAPTCHA is great... Unless you're trying to use it on small pages. The widgets don't scale properly. This is a javascript hack that watches screen size and moves stuff around and resizes accordingly. It works somewhat decent - enough for my standards. The code isn't that hard to follow.

There are three sizes Normal, Small, and Smaller. Once you go away from Normal, there is no going back (This could be fixed, I just didn't want to write the code.) It will alternate between Small and Smaller depending on size.

By default it checks the body for the size. You can edit this and the trigger widths pretty easily.

I've only tested this on the clean theme. No idea what it will do on the others.

#Usage#

Requires jQuery.

Just link the script on your page and it will do its thing. You can also link to:

If you have any issues or questions (or want to make it better), email the email address below, or open an issue at: <https://github.com/korylprince/reCAPTCHA_Responsive/issues>

Can't promise anything though.
